# Naive-Bayes

Naive Bayes is a nonlinear classifier that defines prediction regions using a curve that separates non-linearly distributed observances.

Naive Bayes calcuates posterior probability by multiplying the likelihood and prior probability and dividing by marginal likelihood.

The marginal likelihood is dependent on the parameters established in the algorithim. What is the likelihood of selecting a observation that demonstrates features similar to the predicted datapoint? Note that this assumes that there is a region established by the parameter with a radius. The observances within the region are deemed to have similar features.
